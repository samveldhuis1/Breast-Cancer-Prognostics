# Breast-Cancer-Prognostics
Which patient characteristics best predict recurrence of breast cancer over time?

After some adjustments such as renaming and checking missingness, the descriptives of the 28 selected variables were observed. 
Part of the variables show skewness to the right. 
We can also see 47 (	23.9%, N = 197	) patients have recurrence of breast cancer. 
The largest proportion of lymph node status was 0 with 87 patients ( 44.2% ), meaning 
axillary and other nearby lymph nodes donâ€™t have cancer or only have isolated tumor cells (individual cancer cells), when looked at under a microscope
